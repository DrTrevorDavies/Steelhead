## Introduction

Steelhead migrate through a bunch of fisheries.  What are the differences in exposure to fisheries between recent years of fisheries.


## Method

We build an exposure model for Steelhead

##Results

You can make tables, for example:

```{r , echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(pressure)
```




You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
